### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Alberto Oria

Iâ€™m a software engineer who loves diving deep into how things *really* work â€” from the way operating systems juggle memory to the networks that keep everything talking. Iâ€™m all about low-level programming, game development, and any challenge that makes me scratch my head (in a good way).

Iâ€™ve lived abroad, met people from all over, and learned to adapt quickly â€” not just to new cultures but to new technologies too. I speak Spanish, English, and French, which helps me talk to humans as easily as to machines (well, most of the time).

When Iâ€™m not tinkering with code or exploring new tools, Iâ€™m probably learning something about how games are made, or wondering why that one bug only appears *right before a deadline*.

Letâ€™s build something cool â€” or at least break it in interesting ways. ðŸš€
