### Hi there 👋 I’m Alberto Oria

I’m a software engineer who loves diving deep into how things *really* work — from the way operating systems juggle memory to the networks that keep everything talking. I’m all about low-level programming, game development, and any challenge that makes me scratch my head (in a good way).

I’ve lived abroad, met people from all over, and learned to adapt quickly — not just to new cultures but to new technologies too. I speak Spanish, English, and French, which helps me talk to humans as easily as to machines (well, most of the time).

When I’m not tinkering with code or exploring new tools, I’m probably learning something about how games are made, or wondering why that one bug only appears *right before a deadline*.

Let’s build something cool — or at least break it in interesting ways. 🚀

### ⚙️ Current Project

I’m currently working on **GPU-Accelerated Wavefront Phase Reconstruction** using **OpenCV** and **CUDA/C++**.
This project blends my passion for **scientific image processing**, **computer vision**, and **high-performance GPU programming**, as I explore how optical metrology and software design come together to achieve precision at a microscopic level.
