### Hi there 👋 I’m Alberto Oria

[![My Skills](https://go-skill-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=git,bash,cpp,cuda,opencv,react,ts,express,postman,py,nodejs,linux,vscode,vitest,neovim)](https://skillicons.dev)

I’m a software engineer who loves understanding how things really work — from how operating systems juggle memory to how networks keep everything connected. I enjoy working close to the metal, automating things, and solving problems that make me stop and think for a moment.

I’ve lived abroad, met people from all over, and learned to adapt quickly to new cultures and technologies. I speak Spanish, English, and French, so I can talk to humans almost as easily as I talk to machines (on good days, at least).

When I’m not tinkering with code or exploring new tools, I’m probably speedrunning games, chasing no-hit runs (I even have one in Dark Souls 1, my favorite game), or reading manga like Blame! and Berserk.

I’m drawn to the aesthetics of divine machinery, pipes, cables, and alien-like structures. Axiom Verge captures that perfectly. My favorite zone is the one with the air conditioners in the background — probably the most mesmerizing game environment I’ve ever seen.

Let’s build something cool, or at least break it in interesting ways. 🚀

### ⚙️ Current Project

I’m currently working on **GPU-Accelerated Wavefront Phase Reconstruction** using **OpenCV** and **CUDA/C++**.
This project blends my passion for **scientific image processing**, **computer vision**, and **high-performance GPU programming**, as I explore how optical metrology and software design come together to achieve precision at a microscopic level.
